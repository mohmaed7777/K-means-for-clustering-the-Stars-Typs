# Description:
Astronomers have always been fascinated by the different sizes and colors of stars that they observed. In 1817 a German instrument maker named Joseph von Fraunhofer attached a spectroscope to a telescope and pointed it at the stars. He found that different stars have different absorption lines in their spectra.

The new system reordered the classes into the order OBAFGKM where O stars are the hottest and each successive class is cooler with M being the coolest stars. Each letter was also divided into tenths of the range by adding a number 0-9 to the end. O stars are the least common and M are the most common found in the main sequence of stars. Stars near the beginning or end of their lives are not part of this classification.
